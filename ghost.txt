Deep in the heart of the abandoned mansion, whispers of a ghostly presence echoed through the halls. Its ethereal figure, draped in tattered garments, haunted the decaying rooms. Cold drafts and flickering lights signaled its arrival, sending shivers down the spines of all who dared to enter. The ghost's mournful wails pierced the silence, a sorrowful reminder of its tragic past. Objects moved on their own, a chilling display of supernatural power. Terrified witnesses glimpsed its pale face, frozen in eternal anguish, leaving them with a bone-chilling dread that would linger forever.
